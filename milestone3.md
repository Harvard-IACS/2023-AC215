### Milestone 3: The wheel. Optimization, Monitoring, and Deployment of Scalable Data Solutions

This milestone focuses on the optimization, monitoring, and deployment aspects of a complex data-driven project. It emphasizes efficiency and scalability, utilizing advanced techniques and tools like TensorFlow Lite for model optimization and Kubeflow for machine learning workflows. The integration of a comprehensive performance monitoring system ensures ongoing reliability, and the creation of a "Mega Pipeline" application represents the culminating hands-on experience that brings all elements together in a cohesive, manageable structure.

The third milestone builds on the foundational work of the first, driving the project towards completion and ensuring readiness for real-world application. This will provide students with exposure to industry-standard best practices and hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools and methodologies.

### Key dates:

- Due date: Oct 10th

#### Objectives:

- **Distillation/Quantization/Compression, TF lite**: Implement methods for model optimization such as distillation, quantization, and compression, using TensorFlow Lite. This will enable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

- **Model Performance Monitoring, Data Drift Awareness**: Develop a comprehensive monitoring solution to continuously track model performance, detect data drift, and ensure awareness of other post-release factors that may impact the system. 

- **Kubeflow and Cloud Functions Integration**: Utilize Kubeflow for machine learning workflows and integrate cloud functions to automate and scale various processes within the project, aligning with cloud-native practices.

- **Build a Hands-on Mega Pipeline App**: Design and create a scalable and comprehensive pipeline application that encapsulates all the elements of the project. This "Mega Pipeline" will serve as the unified interface for managing and executing various project components.

### Deliverables:

- **Optimized Models**: Models that have been distilled, quantized, or compressed using TensorFlow Lite, complete with performance benchmarks and analysis.

- **Performance Monitoring Solution**: A well-documented monitoring system that provides insights into model performance, data drift, and other relevant factors. Includes alerting and reporting mechanisms.

- **Kubeflow & Cloud Functions Implementation**: Documentation and code showcasing the successful integration of Kubeflow for machine learning orchestration and cloud functions for process automation.

- **Mega Pipeline Application**: A fully-functional mega pipeline application that serves as the control center for the project, enabling the seamless execution of various components from data ingestion to model deployment. Should include detailed documentation and user guides.
