### Milestone 3 (steam engine): Building a Scalable and Modular Computing Infrastructure

In this milestone, the focus is on developing an advanced training workflows and TensorFlow-based data management will also be implemented to enhance machine learning capabilities and streamline the project's complexities.

### Key dates:

- Due date: Oct 10th

### Objectives:

- **Integrate Distributed Computing and Cloud Storage**: Implement distributed computing solutions using tools like Dask, and align with cloud storage systems that support the scale and complexity of the project.
- **Utilize TensorFlow for Data Management**: Implement TF Data and TF Records to enhance data ingestion and management within machine learning components of the project.
- **Develop Advanced Training Workflows**: Implement and optimize complex training workflows including experiment tracking (W&B), multi-GPU training, serverless training (Vertex AI), and Kubeflow. These should align with the machine learning components and training requirements of the project.

### Deliverables:

- **Containerized Components**: Fully-functional atomic containers for all individual components, aligned and ready for integration within the project architecture.
- **Virtual Environment Setup**: Documented and implemented virtual machines and environments tailored to support the containerized components.
- **Data Pipeline Implementation**: A comprehensive data pipeline with extraction, transformation, and versioning capabilities, including examples of versioned datasets.
- **Distributed Computing and Storage Integration**: Evidence of the implemented distributed computing system and cloud storage solutions, complete with documentation on their configuration and utilization.
- **Machine Learning Workflow Implementation**: Detailed implementation of the advanced training workflows, with evidence of successful training runs, experiment tracking, and utilization of multi-GPU and serverless training.
