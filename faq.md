**Can I view the video recordings for the course?**

Absolutely. All students enrolled in AC215 / CSCIE-115 have access to video recordings for the course.

**Is there a class GitHub repository?**

Indeed. You can find it at [https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2023-AC215](https://github.com/Harvard-IACS/2023-AC215).

**Is it necessary for me to be present for the live lectures?**

While university policies require all AC215 students to attend the lectures, we don't officially record attendance. It's worth mentioning that all lectures are videotaped, so you can watch them later if you can't attend. However, missing the live sessions means you'll miss the opportunity for real-time interaction with the instructors and your classmates.
