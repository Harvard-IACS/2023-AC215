### Milestone 2 (the wheel): *MLOps Infrastructure & Advanced Training Workflows -* Building Atomic Containers, Versioned Data Pipelines, and Scalable Computing Solutions

In this milestone, the focus is on developing a robust and scalable MLOps infrastructure. Teams will build atomic containers for various project components, design data pipelines with version control using tools like Apache Delta Lake, and integrate distributed computing solutions alongside cloud storage

### Key dates:

- Due date: Sep 26th

### Objectives:

- **Build Atomic Containers for Components**: Create containerized solutions for various components using standalone containers that can run independently. This will include the development of atomic containers for individual applications and services involved in the project.
- **Construct Data Pipelines with Versioning**: Design and implement a robust data pipeline that leverages Extract, Transform, Versioning tools like Apache Delta Lake or Pachyderm/DVC. This will enable efficient data handling and version control within the project.
