**Course Topics Overview** 
<span style="color:red">IMPORTANT❗ - Draft more details soon </span>
​


We have designed an in-depth curriculum to ensure a comprehensive understanding of MLOps. Here's a closer look at the topics we'll be covering:
​

1. **Introduction:** 
   - Begin with an understanding of the importance of MLOps and how it fits in the broader AI and software development ecosystem.
​
2. **Virtual Environments and Virtual Machines:** 
   - Delve into the foundations of isolated software environments, their importance in AI development, and how virtual machines offer a layer of abstraction over physical hardware.
​
3. **Containers:** 
   - Understand the concept of containerization using tools like Docker, and how they differ from virtual machines.
​
4. **Cloud Functions:** 
   - Explore serverless architectures, focusing on platforms like GCP Cloud functions (AWS Lambda's equivalent), ensuring efficient model deployment without managing server infrastructures.
​
5. **Data Pipelines, Dask, & Cloud Storage:** 
   - Learn to create efficient data workflows, use Dask for parallel computing, and understand how cloud storage solutions fit into the MLOps ecosystem.
​
6. **TF Data and TF Records:** 
   - Dive into TensorFlow-specific methods for data ingestion and management, ensuring efficient data preprocessing and storage for your models.
​
7. **Data Parallelization:** 
   - Grasp techniques for distributing data processing tasks across multiple processors or nodes.
​
8. **Data Versioning:** 
   - Explore tools like Pachyderm, and understand the significance of maintaining different versions of datasets for reproducibility and model training.
​
9. **Advanced Training Workflows:** 
   - Deep dive into experiment tracking using tools like Weights & Biases, and harness the power of multi-GPU setups for faster model training.
​
10. **Advanced Inference Workflows:** 
   - Understand the nuances of model optimization techniques like Distillation, Quantization, and Compression. Explore TensorFlow Lite, monitor your models post-deployment, and be prepared for challenges like data drift.
​
11. **Pipeline:** 
   - Study end-to-end MLOps pipelines, their components, and best practices to ensure smooth model deployments..
​
13. **App Design, Setup, and Code Organization:** 
   - Best practices in designing user-centric AI applications, setting up your development environment, and organizing code for scalability and maintainability.
​
14. **APIs & Frontend:** 
   - Learn about RESTful APIs to serve your models and design user interfaces for seamless user interactions.
​
15. **Scaling (k8):** 
   - Delve into Kubernetes, its significance in deploying containerized applications, and understand how to scale your applications to cater to millions of users.
​

As we journey through these topics, students will gain a holistic perspective, bridging the gap between model development and real-world deployment. With a blend of theory and practical exercises, this course ensures that by the end, you're not just familiar with these concepts, but proficient in applying them.
