## Course Introduction

In today's AI-driven world, building a robust deep learning model is only half the journey. The real challenge often lies in bringing this model to life in the form of an application that's scalable, maintainable, and ready for real-world deployment. Welcome to AC215: Productionizing AI (MLOps), where we will traverse the complex landscape of Machine Learning Operations. This course has been meticulously curated to provide a holistic understanding of the complete deep learning workflow, from refining your models to deploying them in production environments. By blending the theoretical aspects with hands-on application, we will dive deep into topics like containerization, cloud functions, data pipelines, and advanced training workflows, among others. Our objective is not only to help you grasp these concepts but also to empower you to build and deploy scalable AI applications. Whether you are an AI enthusiast wanting to understand the intricacies of MLOps or a seasoned professional aiming to fortify your knowledge, this course promises a comprehensive exploration of the production side of AI.

## Prerequisites 
​
To ensure a seamless learning experience and to make the most of this course, participants are expected to come with a foundational knowledge in the following areas:
​
1. **Programming Proficiency in Python:** 
   - A strong command over Python's basic constructs, including functions, classes, and modules. Familiarity with libraries like NumPy,  Pandas, Matplotlib is essential, as they form the backbone of many data manipulation tasks in AI.
​
2. **Deep Learning Framework - Tensorflow:** 
   - A working knowledge of the TensorFlow (or PyTorch) framework is crucial, as many topics will delve into its functionalities and methods. Understanding TensorFlow's basic operations, data handling, and model building mechanisms will be invaluable.
​
3. **Basic Shell Commands:** 
   - Comfortability in navigating the command-line interface (CLI), executing shell commands, and performing basic file operations are foundational for many MLOps tasks.
​
4. **Basic Data Structures:** 
   - A good grasp of Python's primary data structures, especially dictionaries and lists, will be instrumental in understanding and manipulating data.
​
5. **File I/O:** 
   - Knowledge of basic file input/output operations in Python, including reading from and writing to files, is vital for tasks involving data storage and manipulation.
​
6. **General AI and ML Concepts:** 
   - While this course is centered around MLOps, a basic understanding of AI and machine learning concepts, including what models are and how they are trained, will set the context for many advanced topics.
​
It's important to note that while prior knowledge in these areas will provide a solid foundation, the course has been structured to ensure gradual progression. Even if you're not an expert in all of the prerequisites, a willingness to learn and engage actively in the course's hands-on components will be crucial for success. If you find yourself struggling with some concepts, we encourage leveraging the course resources, attending office hours, and participating in peer discussions to reinforce your understanding.
