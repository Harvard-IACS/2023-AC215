### Project Milestone 1

**Key dates:**

- project proposals due: Sep 14th
- staff feedback: Sep 19th

#### Objectives:

For the first milestone, your team will **propose a project** that aligns with your personal, professional, and academic interests and passions. 

Allowing you to propose your own projects,  will enhance your engagement and lead to better learning outcomes. This approach will also foster your independence, critical thinking skills, and creativity, preparing you for real-world scenarios where you may be required to initiate and lead your own projects. Call on your inner data scientist and take charge of your project experience.

**Step 1** 

**Teams (Groups of 3-5 students)**

You can use Ed for finding teams, once you have found your matches, please use[ this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zaYPLYblMjNODzoRuZxzOX16HaIkuWCs/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109490521694988502723&rtpof=true&sd=true) to enter your team name and members

**Step 2**

**Submit statement of work** 

Statement of work should be concise and to the point. We are not expecting any group to produce pages and pages of well-written details! Rather, at its core, the proposal should be a unique and innovative idea that presents a data science problem in an engaging and interesting manner. The proposal should make use of any of the methods covered over the span of the course. Finally, ensure that the scope of your problem/question is clear - there should not be any doubts as to what problem/question you are proposing to solve.

In summary, the proposal should include the following information:

**Title and Authors:**
A good title goes a long way in attracting your audienceâ€™s attention. A creative title that is informative and relevant is important. Include the title of the project, your names, and your email address

 **Background and Motivation:**
Briefly describe your reasons for choosing the topic of interest, including any prior background, research interests, or reading (papers, blog posts, etc.) that prompted you to propose your topic.



**Data:****
** Data are an essential part of any data science project, and hence finding reasonable data to work with will be paramount. As part of the proposal, you must provide a source(s) for the data that you will explore in the project, including the data source, a description of the data set, and key attributes of the data set, and its relevance to the problem you wish to explore.

 You are not expected to engage in data cleaning at this stage; however, do indicate if there are any foreseeable problems with data quality that may require substantial work in the exploratory data analysis phase (missingness, merging of datasets, etc.). 

Statement of work  *without references to available, relevant data will not be accepted.**
**
***Scope:****
** With regard to the scope of your work, we leave this largely to you. The project can be as simple or complex as you want it to be, regardless of the topic you choose. However, note that the goal of the project is to demonstrate thoughtfulness in how you approach an interesting problem. For instance, do not use a model/algorithm nobody in the group understands simply because it performs better. Rather, the project should be a place to practice what you learned, build upon lecture ideas, develop research skills, and have fun!

 **Deliverables:****
** **Submit a PDF or word document of your proposal on canvas by the end of the day on** **Sep 14th.**.
