## Project Milestone 1

**Key dates:**

**project proposals due - Sep 14th**

**staff feedback - Sep 19th**

For the first milestone, your team will **propose a project** that aligns with your personal, professional, and academic interests and passions. 

Allowing you to propose your own projects, rather than selecting from a predefined list, will enhance your engagement and lead to better learning outcomes. This approach will also foster your independence, critical thinking skills, and creativity, preparing you for real-world scenarios where you may be required to initiate and lead your own projects. Call on your inner data scientist and take charge of your project experience.

**Step 1** 

**Teams (Groups of 3-5 students)**

You can use Ed for finding teams, once you have found your matches, please use[ this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zaYPLYblMjNODzoRuZxzOX16HaIkuWCs/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109490521694988502723&rtpof=true&sd=true) to enter your team name and members

**Step 2**

**Submit statement of work** 

Statement of work should be concise and to the point. We are not expecting any group to produce pages and pages of well-written details! Rather, at its core, the proposal should be a unique and innovative idea that presents a data science problem in an engaging and interesting manner. The proposal should make use of any of the methods covered over the span of the course. Finally, ensure that the scope of your problem/question is clear - there should not be any doubts as to what problem/question you are proposing to solve.

In summary, the proposal should include the following information:

**Title and Authors:****
** A good title goes a long way in attracting your audience’s attention. A creative title that is informative and relevant is important. Include the title of the project, your names, and your email address

 **Background and Motivation:****
** Briefly describe your reasons for choosing the topic of interest, including any prior background, research interests, or reading (papers, blog posts, etc.) that prompted you to propose your topic.



**Data:****
** Data are an essential part of any data science project, and hence finding reasonable data to work with will be paramount. As part of the proposal, you must provide a source(s) for the data that you will explore in the project, including the data source, a description of the data set, and key attributes of the data set, and its relevance to the problem you wish to explore.

 You are not expected to engage in data cleaning at this stage; however, do indicate if there are any foreseeable problems with data quality that may require substantial work in the exploratory data analysis phase (missingness, merging of datasets, etc.). 

Statement of work  *without references to available, relevant data will not be accepted.**
**
***Scope:****
** With regard to the scope of your work, we leave this largely to you. The project can be as simple or complex as you want it to be, regardless of the topic you choose. However, note that the goal of the project is to demonstrate thoughtfulness in how you approach an interesting problem. For instance, do not use a model/algorithm nobody in the group understands simply because it performs better. Rather, the project should be a place to practice what you learned, build upon lecture ideas, develop research skills, and have fun!

 **Deliverables:****
** **Submit a PDF or word document of your proposal on canvas by the end of the day on** **Sep 14th.**.

During the entire course, you will work in teams and implement a project. The various topics in the class are designed to help you build milestones in an incremental fashion and build towards the end goal. The final outcome with your project will be a fully working AI App.

- Project groups need to be formed by the first or second week of class Date after drop add ?? 

- Group size: 3-5

- Select a project from the list given or bring your own - Are we giving them any list ? previous - **Austin Pets Alive/Visual Question Answering/Caption this image** 

- 

- Criteria for projects are:

- - Deep learning task implemented should include either computer vision or language models or time series data.
  - The end product should be a deployable app that uses the models in the backend in some form

- If you plan to bring your own project idea, the following additional criteria must be met:

- - Dataset size 5 Gigabytes or larger

This is a group assignment that will be done during the entire duration of the course

| Due date for final presentations | Final week of classes |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Due dates for milestones         | Will be announced     |

The project will build on the various topics you learn (or you have learned in previous courses) in the entire course:

- Deep Learning
- Development
- Operations

You will implement all the skills you learn in the various modules. The project will put to the test the skills you have acquired during the entire course. The example projects were designed so that you will need to do data processing and transfer learning for both images and text. Develop and deploy an AI App

We are deliberately not giving **specific instructions**, unlike the previous course homework, so that the problem's overall structure and dynamics are understood and allowing you to be creative and investigative.

The datasets used in the projects are large and this will help you in real-life projects that you might encounter in the future. This will be a challenging task, where you will need to work hand in hand as a team, filling in a software development team's shoes.
